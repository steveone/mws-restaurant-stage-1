# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course - SB Version
---
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

To Run: Download project from github repo.

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. There is a grunt file that requires image magick to be downloaded (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) in order to work. To run this project, you do not need to run the grunt file or download image magick. All required image files are currently included/created for you.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
