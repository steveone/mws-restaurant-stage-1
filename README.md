## Project Stage 3

To Run: Download project from github repo.

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. Install Grunt from npm install grunt --save-dev

2. Install 
    a) Graphics Magick (http://www.graphicsmagick.org/download.html) 
    and 
    b) Image Magick (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) in order to work. 
    
    ****Be sure to update your path to include GraphicsMagick on your system so the grunt file doesn't fail. To run this project, you need to install and run the grunt file.

3. Run Grunt to create the required resposive images. If the images are not there, the service worker may fail depending on your OS.

4. Make sure the mws-restaurant-stage-3 server is online as well.

5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
